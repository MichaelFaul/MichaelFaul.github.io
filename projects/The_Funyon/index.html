            <h2>Bigfoot Spotted Outside Local Grocery Store</h2>
            <p class="break">Local authorites were alerted late Sunday night to suspicious activity in the Baldi's
                parking lot. Upon
                arrival they were shocked by what they found. It wasn't long until they called in local Conservation
                agaents
                and the National Guard. All three agents ended up in a high speed pursuit towards the local State Park.

            <p class="break">
                Pigs are flying and people everywhere are made to pay out on bets made "when pigs can fly". Friday in a
                hurry to start their weekend, employees at Minuscule Biosciences contaminated the pigs drinking water.
                This has lead to a phenomenon everyone once believed impossible.
